/**
 * Bridges one of AE2's per-amount crafting attempts ({@code CraftingCalculation#runCraftAttempt})
 * to the {@link com.moakiee.thunderbolt.core.crafting.planner.CraftPlannerV2} fast path, producing
 * AE2-compatible {@link CraftingPlan}s.
 *
 * <p>This is Thunderbolt's single production fast-planner entry. Ordinary AE2 patterns, overload
 * patterns and contracted closed-loop patterns all enter through this adapter; capability interfaces
 * in {@code core.crafting.pattern}, {@code core.crafting.overload} and {@code core.crafting.loop}
 * describe the extra facts needed by the same graph build and solve.
 *
 * <p>Hooking the per-amount attempt (rather than the whole {@code computePlan}) lets AE2 keep driving
 * its own strategy/binary-search loop while we replace only the expensive tree simulation of each
 * attempt. The contract of {@code runCraftAttempt(simulate, amount)} is mirrored exactly:
 * {@code simulate=false} returns a feasible plan or {@code null} (this amount can't be made);
 * {@code simulate=true} must return a non-null plan carrying the missing items.
 *
 * <p>Engine: the v2 planner ({@link CraftPlannerV2}) — a linear topological backbone with a bounded
 * backtracking fallback for contention. It natively handles byproducts and multiple competing recipes.
 *
 * <p>Correctness rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Modeled in-engine (no decline): byproducts (shared pool), hard-fuzzy substitution (OR
 *       expansion), catalysts/non-degrading containers ({@code returned}), filled containers
 *       (consumed + leftover byproduct, e.g. bucket→empty), durability tools (use-token chain), and
 *       emittable items (infinite on-demand source → {@code emittedItems}). A recipe step we still
 *       cannot model (e.g. a durability chain longer than the cyclic budget) is dropped so its item
 *       surfaces as <em>missing</em> rather than declining the whole attempt.</li>
 *   <li><b>Recursion / cycle</b> → handled in-engine: the v2 planner breaks back-edges ("去头尾") so a
 *       compress/decompress pair (1 block ⇄ 9 ingots) is planned directly instead of declining. The
 *       reverse side resolves from stock/missing; cuts only remove options, never overstate feasibility.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>feasible</b> plan is always safe to return (mass-balanced ⇒ executable), even with
 *       byproducts and multiple recipe choices.</li>
 *   <li><b>Proven infeasible</b>: best-effort, never declined (Policy A).
 *       {@code simulate=false}→null, {@code simulate=true}→partial plan with missing items.</li>
 *   <li><b>Search budget exhausted</b>: stop enumerating alternatives and finish the current route
 *       deterministically from the already-built graph and current shared pools. Its missing items are
 *       exposed through AE2's simulation result. The missing list is a targeted replenishment
 *       suggestion, not a proof about every alternate route; no second diagnostic plan is run.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Execution-time contract (fuzzy substitution).</b> For a hard-fuzzy slot the planner commits to a
 * <em>concrete</em> substitute (the most-available option in the chosen combination) and charges that exact
 * key as used. AE2 still fires the single real {@link IPatternDetails}, and at extraction time its fuzzy
 * matcher may pull a <em>different</em> acceptable stack than the one the plan charged (e.g. a different
 * NBT/damage variant, or a different tag member that happened to be in the same slot). The plan stays
 * mass-balanced for the key it charged, but the network can end up consuming a sibling substitute instead.
 * This is an <b>execution-time</b> concern, not a planning one: reconciling "what the plan charged" with
 * "what the fuzzy slot actually resolved" is the responsibility of the executing CPU (the batch crafting
 * CPU logic), which sees the real extraction. The planner intentionally does not try to predict AE2's
 * runtime fuzzy resolution here — see the batch CPU logic for the execution-side fix.
 *
 * <p><b>Planning-side ID_ONLY (ignore-NBT) aggregation.</b> Overload patterns may mark an input slot
 * {@code ID_ONLY}: at execution any stack sharing the item id is accepted regardless of NBT. For such a
 * slot the planner expands the candidate set with every same-item stack already in the network (via
 * {@code findFuzzyTemplates}/{@code IGNORE_ALL}) <em>and</em> every same-item key some pattern can
 * craft ({@code ICraftingService#getCraftables}), so the slot can be supplied by stock under any NBT
 * and by any producer pattern — strict plain, strict overload, or ID_ONLY overload (whose declared
 * outputs are component-wiped, see {@code Ae2OverloadPatternDetails}) — regardless of which NBT
 * variant that producer declares. Without this the planner would only see the exact declared template
 * and report a false shortfall whenever the item is held or crafted under a different NBT variant.
 * STRICT slots are intentionally not expanded: a producer whose output NBT differs must not satisfy
 * them.
 *
 * <p>Byte accounting reproduces AE2's formulas (see {@code CraftingTreeNode#request},
 * {@code CraftingTreeProcess#request} and {@code ICraftingSimulationState#addStackBytes}) over the
 * memoized DAG: byte-identical to AE2 for jobs without shared sub-graphs, smaller otherwise.

     *
     * <p><b>Chains are matched to SLOT semantics, not just to the item.</b> {@code getRemainingKey} is
     * per-input: one recipe may cost 1 durability per craft, another 2. The chain is built by stepping
     * <em>this slot's</em> rule, so a 2-per-craft slot yields a chain whose length is the firings a full
     * tool survives — self-consistent on its own.
     *
     * <p><b>Anchoring at the fullest tool.</b> A slot's declared template need not be the full tool: an
     * overload pattern is captured from real items the player inserts, so its template is frequently a
     * <em>partially used</em> tool, while the tool that will actually refill the pool is crafted brand
     * new (full). Building the chain straight from a damaged template would miss the fuller variants
     * above it and, worse, never discover the tool's own craft recipe (that recipe's output is the full
     * key, which nothing else would poll). {@link #fullestAnchor} therefore relocates the anchor to the
     * fullest same-item variant the slot accepts (craftable variant first, à la AE2's
     * {@code CraftingTreeNode.findCraftedStack}, otherwise the longest-downward-walk stock variant). That
     * makes the fullest tool the single carrier for every slot on the orbit, so discovery order stops
     * mattering and we never need to re-anchor a chain backward.
     *
     * <p><b>Merge by connectivity ("相接"), not by item identity.</b> {@code linkOwner} indexes every
     * link of every already-built chain back to that chain. When a slot's (anchored) start key is
     * already a link of an existing chain we <em>reuse</em> that chain — but only when this slot's own
     * step from that link lands on the chain's <em>next</em> link, i.e. the two share the same
     * durability-per-craft granularity and lie on one orbit. That is precisely the case where two slots
     * start at different damage levels of the same tool yet connect into one chain, so pooling their
     * stock once is sound. If the step lands elsewhere (e.g. a 2-per-craft slot meeting a 1-per-craft
     * chain), the same physical tools would be priced in two incompatible "uses" units on one pool with
     * no sound linear split, so it reports an item-local conflict. The graph is then rebuilt with that
     * item represented as concrete whole-item inputs; unrelated durability items retain their reduced
     * chains. The same conflict is reported when a fresh chain's links overlap keys already priced as
     * whole items ({@code itemUnitKeys}) or links owned by another chain.
     *
     * <p>Returns {@link ChainLookup#NONE} when this slot is not a reducible durability tool (plain
     * item, container, or a chain longer than {@link #FUZZY_CYCLE_STEPS}).
