/**
 * Result of {@link CraftPlanner#plan}.
 *
 * @param supported     {@code false} means the fast path declined (e.g. recursion/cycle detected);
 *                      caller must fall back to AE2's simulator. When {@code false} all other fields
 *                      are empty/zero.
 * @param feasible      {@code true} if the requested amount can be fully crafted from current stock.
 *                      When {@code false}, {@link #missing} lists what is short (a partial plan is
 *                      still provided for the craftable part).
 * @param firings       pattern -> number of times to fire it (the compact plan). Keyed by pattern
 *                      object identity.
 * @param usedStock     item -> amount drawn directly from the inventory snapshot.
 * @param missing       item -> amount that could not be obtained (raw leaves under DEEP mode).
 * @param grossDemand   item -> total amount requested before drawing from stock (one entry per
 *                      visited item). Exposed so the AE2 adapter can reproduce AE2's byte accounting
 *                      ({@code addStackBytes} is charged on the pre-extraction request amount).
 * @param itemsProcessed number of distinct items visited in the demand pass. Exposed so tests can
 *                       assert the planner is O(reachable items), never exponential.
 * @param budgetExhausted {@code true} if the bounded search hit a node's per-node visit cap and had
 *                       to commit a best-effort result instead of continuing to search. This is the
 *                       only situation in which the plan may be worse than AE2's exhaustive simulator
 *                       (the chosen exhaustion policy returns best-effort rather than declining). On
 *                       normal graphs it stays {@code false}: contention never approaches the cap.
 * @param <K> item key type
