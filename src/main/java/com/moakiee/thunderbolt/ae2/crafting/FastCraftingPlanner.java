/**
 * Bridges one of AE2's per-amount crafting attempts ({@code CraftingCalculation#runCraftAttempt})
 * to the linear {@link CraftPlanner} fast path, producing AE2-compatible {@link CraftingPlan}s.
 *
 * <p>Hooking the per-amount attempt (rather than the whole {@code computePlan}) lets AE2 keep driving
 * its own strategy/binary-search loop while we replace only the expensive tree simulation of each
 * attempt. The contract of {@code runCraftAttempt(simulate, amount)} is mirrored exactly:
 * {@code simulate=false} returns a feasible plan or {@code null} (this amount can't be made);
 * {@code simulate=true} must return a non-null plan carrying the missing items.
 *
 * <p>Engine: the v2 planner ({@link CraftPlannerV2}) — a linear topological backbone with a bounded
 * backtracking fallback for contention. It natively handles byproducts and multiple competing recipes.
 *
 * <p>Correctness rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Modeled in-engine (no decline): byproducts (shared pool), hard-fuzzy substitution (OR
 *       expansion), catalysts/non-degrading containers ({@code returned}), filled containers
 *       (consumed + leftover byproduct, e.g. bucket→empty), durability tools (use-token chain), and
 *       emittable items (infinite on-demand source → {@code emittedItems}). A recipe step we still
 *       cannot model (e.g. a durability chain longer than the cyclic budget) is dropped so its item
 *       surfaces as <em>missing</em> rather than declining the whole attempt.</li>
 *   <li><b>Recursion / cycle</b> → handled in-engine: the v2 planner breaks back-edges ("去头尾") so a
 *       compress/decompress pair (1 block ⇄ 9 ingots) is planned directly instead of declining. The
 *       reverse side resolves from stock/missing; cuts only remove options, never overstate feasibility.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>feasible</b> plan is always safe to return (mass-balanced ⇒ executable), even with
 *       byproducts and multiple recipe choices.</li>
 *   <li><b>Infeasible</b>: best-effort, never declined (Policy A). {@code simulate=false}→null,
 *       {@code simulate=true}→partial plan with missing items. We do NOT fall back to AE2's exhaustive
 *       simulator even if the bounded search hit its per-node cap — that slow path is exactly what this
 *       engine replaces; the per-node cap keeps work bounded and our result is mass-balanced/safe.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Execution-time contract (fuzzy substitution).</b> For a hard-fuzzy slot the planner commits to a
 * <em>concrete</em> substitute (the most-available option in the chosen combination) and charges that exact
 * key as used. AE2 still fires the single real {@link IPatternDetails}, and at extraction time its fuzzy
 * matcher may pull a <em>different</em> acceptable stack than the one the plan charged (e.g. a different
 * NBT/damage variant, or a different tag member that happened to be in the same slot). The plan stays
 * mass-balanced for the key it charged, but the network can end up consuming a sibling substitute instead.
 * This is an <b>execution-time</b> concern, not a planning one: reconciling "what the plan charged" with
 * "what the fuzzy slot actually resolved" is the responsibility of the executing CPU (the batch crafting
 * CPU logic), which sees the real extraction. The planner intentionally does not try to predict AE2's
 * runtime fuzzy resolution here — see the batch CPU logic for the execution-side fix.
 *
 * <p>Byte accounting reproduces AE2's formulas (see {@code CraftingTreeNode#request},
 * {@code CraftingTreeProcess#request} and {@code ICraftingSimulationState#addStackBytes}) over the
 * memoized DAG: byte-identical to AE2 for jobs without shared sub-graphs, smaller otherwise.
